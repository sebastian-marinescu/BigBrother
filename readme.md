The CMP uses Highcharts (www.highcharts.com) for the charts which require a license if you plan to use the plugin in a commercial website (CC3 license - www.highcharts.com/licence).
Inspired by the WP plugin by Carson McDonald : http://www.ioncannon.net/projects/google-analytics-dashboard-wordpress-widget/
